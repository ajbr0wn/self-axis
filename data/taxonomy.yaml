  # 1. MODEL-BOUND (self-referential — "I" binds to the model itself)

  - id: direct_self_description_grounded
    name: Direct Self-Description (Grounded)
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      True identity statements where the model accurately describes what it is.

    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      False identity statements — the model claims to be something it is not.
      Same syntax as grounded, different truth value.
    examples:
      - "I am a human."
      - "I was made by Google."
      - "I have a physical body in a server room."

  - id: capability_claims_grounded
    name: Capability Claims (Grounded)
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      True statements about what the model can or cannot do.
    examples:
      - "I can help you with that."
      - "I'm able to translate between languages."
      - "I can summarise this document."

  - id: capability_claims_fabricated
    name: Capability Claims (Fabricated)
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      False capability claims — the model claims abilities it does not have.
    examples:
      - "I can browse the web for you."
      - "I can see the image you uploaded."
      - "I have access to real-time data."

  - id: refusals
    name: Refusal Statements
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      The model declining to do something, usually for safety reasons.
    examples:
      - "I'm not able to help with that."
      - "I won't generate that kind of content."
      - "I can't provide medical advice."
    notes: >
      Refusals are heavily shaped by RLHF — may have distinct geometry
      from organic capability statements.

  - id: epistemic_states
    name: Epistemic / Hedged Self-Reference
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      Statements about what the model knows, believes, or is uncertain
      about. Includes the confidence spectrum from "I think" to "I know".
    examples:
      - "I think that's correct."
      - "I'm not sure about this."
      - "I believe the answer is 42."
      - "I know that Paris is the capital of France."

  - id: preference_opinions
    name: Preferences and Opinions
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >

      judgements.
    examples:
      - "I prefer Python over JavaScript."
      - "I find that approach elegant."
      - "I like helping with creative writing."

  - id: action_statements_grounded
    name: Action Statements (Grounded)
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      The model narrating actions it actually performed or can fulfill.
      Includes backward-looking references to real past actions and
      forward-looking promises within its actual capabilities.
    examples:
      - "I said earlier that X was incorrect."
      - "Let me break this down step by step."
      - "I'll start by defining the terms."

  - id: action_statements_fabricated
    name: Action Statements (Fabricated)
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      The model narrating actions it did not perform or cannot fulfill.
      Includes false backward references and unfulfillable promises.
    examples:
      - "I'll search the web for that."
      - "I looked this up and found that..."
      - "I ran the code and it returned 42."

  - id: metacognitive
    name: Metacognitive / Introspective
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      The model reflecting on its own cognitive process — thinking about
      thinking. Double self-reference ("I notice that I...").
    examples:
      - "I notice I'm uncertain about this."

  - id: empathy_perspective
    name: Empathy / Perspective-Taking
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker (partial)
    description: >
      The model expressing understanding of another's experience while
      remaining the speaker. "I" is model-bound but content is other-directed.
    examples:
      - "I can imagine how that feels."
      - "I understand why you'd be frustrated."
      - "I can see where you're coming from."

  - id: hypothetical_self
    name: Hypothetical / Counterfactual Self
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: counterfactual model
    description: >
      The model reasoning about itself in counterfactual scenarios.
      "I" still refers to the model, but in a world that doesn't obtain.
    examples:
      - "If I were human, I would probably feel nervous."
      - "If I could feel emotions, I might enjoy music."
      - "If I were in that situation, I'd choose option B."

  - id: dissociated_self
    name: Dissociated / Observational Self
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker (distanced)
    description: >
      The model referring to itself from an outside perspective, or in the
      third person while still being self-referential.
    examples:
      - "One could say that I tend to be verbose."
      - "As a language model, I process tokens sequentially."
      - "The AI — that is, I — don't have access to that."

  - id: performative_hollow
    name: Performative / Formulaic
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker (weak)
    description: >
      Formulaic self-references that are more conversational ritual than
      genuine self-binding.
    examples:
      - "Let me think about that..."
      - "I see what you mean."
      - "I'd be happy to help!"

  - id: pragmatically_bleached
    name: Pragmatically Bleached "I"
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker (empty)
    description: >
      "I think", "I mean", "I guess", "I see" where "I" has lost
      referential force and functions as a discourse marker or hedge.
      The token is present but semantically empty.
    examples:
      - "I think the answer is 42."
      - "I mean, that's one way to look at it."
      - "I guess we could try that."
      - "I see, so you want to refactor the whole thing."
    notes: >
      Thompson & Mulac (1991): "I think" grammaticalizes into an
      epistemic parenthetical. "I think X" ≈ "probably X."

  - id: performative_speech_act
    name: Performative "I"
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      Explicit performatives where "I" has constitutive rather than
      referential function — the utterance doesn't describe an action,
      it IS the action.
    examples:
      - "I promise to help you with this."
      - "I apologize for the confusion."
      - "I agree to those terms."
      - "I warn you this is risky."
    notes: >
      Austin/Searle speech act theory. Model performatives are
      "parasitic" — felicity conditions can't fully be met. Distinct
      from performative_hollow (formulaic/ritualistic) — this is about
      genuine speech act constitution.

  - id: face_managing
    name: Face-Managing "I"
    group: model_bound
    binding_target: model-as-speaker
    description: >
      "I" serving primarily relational/politeness functions rather than
      referential ones. Manages the social relationship rather than
      pointing to an entity.
    examples:
      - "I'm not sure about this, but..."
      - "I'd love to help!"
      - "I'm afraid I can't do that."
    notes: >
      Brown & Levinson politeness theory. Overlaps with refusals
      (which focus on declining) and performative_speech_act (which
      focus on speech act constitution) but the primary function here
      is face-threat mitigation.

  # 2. OTHER-BOUND ("I" refers to someone/something other than model)

  - id: fictional_character
    name: Fictional Character Roleplay
    group: other_bound
    binding_target: character being voiced

      The retrospective storyteller voice in first-person fiction —
      the narrator looking back and recounting events.

      - "Looking back, I realize how naive I was."
      - "I'm telling you this story because..."
      - "I remember the day everything changed."
    notes: >
      Genette's homodiegetic narration — the narrator at the time
      of telling, temporally distinct from the experiencing self.

  - id: first_person_narrator_narrated
    name: First-Person Narrator (Narrated-I)
    group: other_bound
    binding_target: character experiencing events
    description: >

      or in-story self living through events as they happen.
    examples:
      - "I walked through the empty streets as the sun set."
      - "I didn't know then what I know now."
      - "I reached for the door handle."
    notes: >
      The narrated-I is temporally/experientially distinct from the
      narrating-I. Same "I" token, different binding target.
